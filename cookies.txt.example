# Cookies file for YouTube authentication
# This file should be in Netscape HTTP Cookie format
# 
# HOW TO GENERATE THIS FILE:
# ===========================
#
# Option 1: Using a browser extension (Recommended)
# -------------------------------------------------
# 1. Install "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" extension:
#    - Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc
#    - Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/
#
# 2. Go to https://www.youtube.com and make sure you're logged in
#
# 3. Click the extension icon and click "Export" or "Download"
#
# 4. Save the file as "cookies.txt" in this project directory
#
# Option 2: Using yt-dlp directly (requires browser on same machine)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Run: yt-dlp --cookies-from-browser chrome --cookies cookies.txt https://www.youtube.com
# This extracts cookies from your Chrome browser automatically.
# (Replace "chrome" with "firefox", "safari", "edge", etc. as needed)
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# ================
# - Never commit this file to git (it's in .gitignore)
# - Cookies expire, you may need to regenerate periodically
# - Use a dedicated YouTube account you don't care about
# - For Coolify: upload this file as a "secret file" and mount it at /app/cookies.txt
#
# Example cookie format:
# .youtube.com	TRUE	/	TRUE	1735689600	CONSENT	YES+
# .youtube.com	TRUE	/	TRUE	1735689600	LOGIN_INFO	...
